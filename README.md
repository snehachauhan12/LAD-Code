Hi, this is the code for Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) implemented in python. LAD is a data analysis method that uses the concepts of Boolean functions. There are three files- Binarization, Support Set Generation and Pattern Generation. Binarzation is used to convert the numerical data into binary values. Support Set generation is used to select relevant features from the dataset. Patten Generation is the process to generate pattens which are combination of features of the support set.
